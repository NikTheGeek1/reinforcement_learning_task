# GridWorld - 2D Reinforcement Learning Simulation

GridWorld is a 2D simulation game designed to help users experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms such as **Value Iteration**, **Q-Learning**, and **Monte-Carlo**. The game provides an engaging environment to learn and apply reinforcement learning concepts.

## Features

- Train agents to complete predefined tasks.
- Analyze agent performance and decision-making.
- Compare different reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Interactive and educational platform for reinforcement learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gridworld.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gridworld
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you're using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production build, use:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Usage

- Launch the application and select an agent to train.
- Choose an algorithm (Value Iteration, Q-Learning, Monte-Carlo).
- Observe the learning process and analyze agent decisions via visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **React** â€“ for building the user interface.
